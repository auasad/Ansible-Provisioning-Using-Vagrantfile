In this project we will provision an ansible file(larawal.yml for this project) usig Vagrantfile.
let's start it.

Step 01: Fork this repo into your Github account
1. On your terminal type the command;

    git clone https://github.com/auasad/Ansible-Provisioning-Using-Vagrantfile.git
    
   This will clone the Ansible-Provisioning-Using-Vagrantfile into your local machine.
   
2. Get into the directory you have just clone   
   cd Ansible-Provisioning-Using-Vagrantfile    //To get into the directory
   ls Ansible-Provisioning-Using-Vagrantfile    //To list the content of the directory
   
  Here, you will see the code, conf and provisioning directories along with Vagrantfile.

Step 02: Set up vagrant:
To set up the vagrant here is the link https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
it will also required a provider i.e. virtual box or vmware , here is the link for virtualbox https://www.virtualbox.org/ 

Step 03: Install Ansible on your local machine
For Ansible installation, here is the link https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/installation_guide/intro_installation.html

Step 04: Configuring the Ansible Host
After Ansible Installation just go to the Host directory of  ansible and add the "127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local" just as below;

cd /etc/ansible/
vim host

And add the following lines;
[localhost]
127.0.0.1 ansible_connection=local

save the file.

Step 0: Running Vagrantfile
Now its the time to run the Vagrantfile.

cd Ansible-Provisioning-Using-Vagrantfile
vagrant up

This will spin a VM on your virtualbox using Vagrantfile and will provision ansible fil.
